# ThunderTweaks

It is a fork of hKTweaks [hKTweaks](https://github.com/corsicanu/hKtweaks) and MoroGoku's [MTweaks](https://github.com/morogoku/MTweaks-KernelAdiutorMOD), properly adaptated to exynos7870/7880/7884/7885/7904/8890 devices (maybe even more).
Original hKTweaks and MTweaks app is a Mod of Grarak's [KernelAdiutor](https://github.com/Grarak/KernelAdiutor) for compatibilize to Samsung Exynos.
Thanks to Willi Ye for this great application.
First version of ThunderTweaks v1.0.0 is builded from hKTweaks v1.1.5 and MTWeaks v2.14.0.
I've added some fixes and new stuff for better work with ThundeRStormS kernel : (https://github.com/ThunderStorms21th/Galaxy-S7-Pie-kernel) and (https://github.com/ThunderStorms21th/Galaxy-S7-kernel).
